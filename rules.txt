---------- GAME RULES ----------

A token is placed only on a space so that it is adjacent to an opposing token and that
opposing piece is "flanked" or "sandwiched" with another of our pieces.
You can "Flank" more than one piece, but you must at least "flank" one enemy piece.

The game ends when it is no longer possible for any player to make moves.


---------- STRATEGIES ----------

There are strategies that can be applied to make movements that improve the results of
a player.

This helps us make our AI much more intelligent, without having to go through many
state spaces of the game tree.
